# Pacman_Search

## Project for UMW AI Course 415

you should be able to play a game of Pac-Man by typing the following at the command line:

python pacman.py

Pac-Man lives in a shiny blue world of twisting corridors and tasty round treats. Navigating this world efficiently will be Pac-Man's first step in mastering his domain.
Note that pacman.py supports a number of options that can each be expressed in a long way (e.g., --layout) or a short way (e.g., -l). You can see the list of all options and their default values via:

python pacman.py -h
